# Daily Wisdom
## About
A list of insights to help manage daily life (if you are like me). Collected over time, mostly in response to insights or ideas encountered. Life lessons, learned the hard way.

## How-To
I recommend picking one to focus on each day. If it's relevant to today, use it in that context; otherwise, use it to think about things "outside of the box" you're currently inside.
